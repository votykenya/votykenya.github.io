    <!--h2> Why </h2-->
    <p>
         The Voice of Youth (VOTY) was founded in the year 2005 by Joyce Akinyi Opondo, who stays in Kindu-Bay town in Homabay County
        where she settled after her retirement from public service. She knows poverty and its scourge from her
        interaction and experience in her community
    </p>
    <p>
        Homabay County bears the largest brunt of the HIV/Aids scourge in Kenya. Out of the 1.6 million people with
        HIV/Aids in the country, 10 per cent or 159,970 were in Homabay in 2016 as were 4,629 people or 10 per cent of
        the national total who died of Aids-related complications. Besides the 159,970 people living with Aids in the county,
        it also records 15,000 new infections annually with 49 per cent of the residents living below the poverty line.
    </p>
    <p>
        According to the First Homabay Multisector Aids Strategic Plan (2014/2015-2018/2019), the main drivers of HIV/Aids
        the eight sub-counties are poverty, cultural and sexual attitude and behavior, the fishing industry networks,
        lifestyle related factors, health risk behavior and professional related issues. Mbita Sub-County has the highest
        number of HIV/Aids individuals at 26 per cent.
    </p>
    <p>
        The County also has the worst adolescent reproductive health outcomes in Kenya. Teenage pregnancy is at an
        alarming rate of 33% against a national average of 18% making it the second highest count with teenage pregnancy
        incidences in Kenya. (UNFPA Report 2016). It is also home to one girl child aged 9 years, married, pregnant and
        HIV positive! However, the girl is not an isolated case. The County is full of young adolescent girls with babies
        of their own. It is a sub-county of babies carrying babies. From a population of 1.1 million in the Homabay County,
        48.8 per cent of the people are largely dependents aged under 14 years, most of them orphans.
    </p>
    <p>
        In Homabay county, grandmothers and elderly widows aged 60-plus years are the heads of most homesteads where they
        take care orphaned children under very difficult circumstances. This is the bane of Homabay County whose eight
        sub-counties are all reeling under the weight of the HIV burden. Although the eight sub-counties of Kasipul,
        Kabondo, Karachuonyo, Homabay township, Ndhiwa, Suba, Mbita and Rangwe, are all affected by the pandemic, the
        last three are the worst hit.
    </p>
    <p>
        The biggest drivers of the high HIV/Aids prevalence rates and equally high number of new infections include
        poverty and retrogressive cultural practices. The fishing folk popularly known as the Jaboya subscribe to an
        unorthodox “fish for sex behavior” along the many beaches in Suba and Mbita sub-counties. Along these fish
        landing beaches, uncontrolled and unprotected sex among female fishmongers, fishermen, schoolgirls and
        commercial sex workers has become the biggest mode of transmitting the virus.
    </p>
    <p>
        This fish trade and its sad consequences also attracts fishermen from Uganda and Tanzania. The large number of
        Traditional Birth Attendants (TBAs) also poses obstacles to skilled deliveries with Suba alone hosting more than
        90 TBAs and whose “popularity” frustrates the work of professional health-care givers.
    </p>
    <p>
        As a result, Voice for Change was founded to address the worst plight of the youths and women in Kendu-Bay. The
        scourge brought with it the high school drop outs among the children and the youths in the County. As such,
        Voice of the Youths initiated interventions that were aimed at increasing school retention especially for the girl
        child, youths behavior change interventions and women economic empowerment in Kendu-Bay of Homa Bay County.
