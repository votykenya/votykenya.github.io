        This is a scheme where members save and borrow to address their challenges, development, and social welfare.
    </p>

    <p>
        Member’s financial capacity was too low that could not effectively address their challenges without a financial
        intervention. Member’s challenges were:
    </p>

    <ol>
        <li>In adequate payment of school fees ( right from nursery to higher learning institutions)</li>
        <li>Poor housing to members ( grass thatched houses with cracked walls and leaking roofs)</li>
        <li>Lack of basic needs</li>
        <li>Poor Social welfare ( example; when one loses a dear one)</li>
        <li>Slow and weak general development. </li>
    </ol>

    <h4>How we do it:</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>
            In the year 2008, Members started with a merry go round where members were paying only ksh20 per week.
            Ksh15 was left to the member whose house was a meeting place while 5ksh went to member’s savings.
            This went on up to end of 2010. It improved relationship and addressed some of the challenges.
        </li>
        <li>
            From 2011 January the group improved to table banking method. In this method people raise money at a pool
            on weekly basis and was lent to individual(s) with need. This money was paid back in a month’s time with
            interest of 15%. All the money with interest were paid back to members according to their savings on yearly
            basis. This improved the address of member’s challenges but had its shortcomings of huge interest to the borrower.
        </li>
        <li>
            19th December 2014 the group founded a fully, legally registered SACCO under the ministry of cooperative ACT
            CAP 490 section 6 under a registration number CS/17565 in the name of  Rachuonyo Voty Women Rural Savings
            And Credit Co-operative Society Limited.
        </li>
    </ol>

    <p>
        We still meet on weekly basis and individual(s) saves and borrows’ from the SACCO as guided by the bylaws of the
        SACCO. We have challenge of limited resources but this has improved the address of most of our challenges. The
        program of lending and borrowing is a REAL relief to the Rural WOMAN and the YOUTH that we appeal to anyone with
        big heart to help us raise and avail more funds for further address to our challenges more so in the area of education.
